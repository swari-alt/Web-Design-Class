<h2>Kathmandu Streets</h2>
<p>
The streets of Kathmandu come to life with color. An elderly woman prays on the street. Movement of cars and feel wake up the streets.

<blockquote>
“The sky was bright blue, and the sun shone on their faces. The temple bells sounded, a dear ding-dong that reverberated inside his body, then expanded into their surroundings.”

<h3>Postcard from My Future Trip</h3>
<p>
Dear future me,
<br /><br />
Today I watched the mountains reflect perfectly on the water.
Everything felt quiet in the best possible way.
I wish I could bottle this feeling.
<br /><br />
— Me, someday in Nepal

<h2>Why This Matters to Me</h2>
<p>
Nepal represents more than a place on a map. It feels like a symbol of
calm and adventure at the same time. Creating this page is
a way of imagining a future journey and reminding myself that meaningful
places exist beyond everyday routines.
